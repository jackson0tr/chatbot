The primary objectives of a literature review are to establish the context and significance of the research problem, identify gaps or areas of controversy in the existing literature, and justify the need for the current study.",
      "When writing a literature review, it's essential to follow a coherent structure. This often involves organizing the review around key themes, concepts, or research questions. The structure may vary depending on the specific requirements of the thesis and the discipline, but commonly includes an introduction, thematic sections discussing relevant literature, critical analysis of the literature, and a conclusion that synthesizes key findings and identifies avenues for future research.",
